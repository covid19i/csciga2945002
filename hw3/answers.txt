Even though I calculated the correction terms sequentially, adding the correction term to each element in the scan vector (prefix_sum in code) can be done in parallel. I have used a parallel for that. Without that, the performance is worse than sequential as expected. Performance was best with number of threads 8 when N = 100000000.
